\chapter{Third-Party Code and Libraries}
%
% If you have made use of any third party code or software libraries, i.e. any code
% that you have not designed and written yourself, then you must include this appendix.
%
% As has been said in lectures, it is acceptable and likely that you will make use of
%  third-party code and software libraries. If third party code or libraries are used,
%   your work will build on that to produce notable new work. The key requirement is that we
%   understand what is your original work and what work is based on that of other people.
%
% Therefore, you need to clearly state what you have used and where the original material can be
% found. Also, if you have made any changes to the original versions, you must explain what you have changed.
%
% As an example, you might include a definition such as:
%
% Apache POI library - The project has been used to read and write Microsoft Excel files (XLS) as
%  part of the interaction with the client's existing system for processing data. Version 3.10-FINAL
%   was used. The library is open source and it is available from the Apache Software Foundation
% \cite{apache_poi}. The library is released using the Apache License
% \cite{apache_license}. This library was used without modification.
