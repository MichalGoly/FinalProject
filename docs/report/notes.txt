# Manual Testing
Have a look at my comments in MMP_S11. The table is one way to report tests,
but not the only way. If you have automated tests, then discuss what you have
done and why - but you don't need to produce a table equivalent of those tests.

You might want a test table to talk about areas that aren't automated. In that
case, the test table could go in an appendix and discussion of the approach and
any particularly interesting items in the body of the report.
