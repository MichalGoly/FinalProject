\chapter{Background \& Objectives}

% This section should discuss your preparation for the project, including background
% reading, your analysis of the problem and the process or method you have followed
% to help structure your work.  It is likely that you will reuse part of your outline
% project specification, but at this point in the project you should have more to talk about.

\section{Background}
% What was your background preparation for the project? What similar systems did
% you assess? What was your motivation and interest in this project?

\subsection{Motivation}
I enjoy programming, and this project seemed to involve a lot of coding. I was also excited
to build a complex, real time system, while applying my previous software engineering
experience and learning new technologies at the same time. I knew I would be given
a lot of freedom to choose the most appropriate tools for the task, and incorporate
modern software development practices, including continuous integration and
containerised environments, to deliver good quality software. I was also keen on developing something that could be actually
useful to the university once I leave Aberystwyth. It is more motivating to develop
a product, while knowing it could be potentially used in real life, as opposed to being
forgotten after the submission. I have experienced being presented with wrong slides
during a lecture in my first year at university, so I was happy to address the problem
of a single session Quizdom license with my tool.

\subsection{Background Research}

\section{Analysis}
% Taking into account the problem and what you learned from the background work,
% what was your analysis of the problem? How did your analysis help to decompose
% the problem into the main tasks that you would undertake? Were there alternative
% approaches? Why did you choose one approach compared to the alternatives?
%
% There should be a clear statement of the objectives of the work, which you will
% evaluate at the end of the work.
%
% In most cases, the agreed objectives or requirements will be the result of a compromise
% between what would ideally have been produced and what was determined to be possible in
%  the time available. A discussion of the process of arriving at the final list is usually appropriate.
%
% As mentioned in the lectures, think about possible security issues for the project topic.
%  Whilst these might not be relevant for all projects, do consider if there are relevant
%   for your project. Where there are relevant security issues, discuss how they will
%   this affect the work that you are doing. Carry forward this discussion into relevant
%    areas for design, implementation and testing.

\section{Process}
% You need to describe briefly the life cycle model or research method that you used. You
%  do not need to write about all of the different process models that you are aware of.
%  Focus on the process model that you have used. It is possible that you needed to adapt
%  an existing process model to suit your project; clearly identify what you used and how
%  you adapted it for your needs.
