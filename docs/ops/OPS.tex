%==============================================================================
\section{Project description}
%==============================================================================
Student engagement and live knowledge monitoring are vital in the provision of good quality
lecture content in 2018. It is important to make sure audience understands concepts presented,
and quizes can help lecturers judge students' understanding in real time.

Aberystwyth University currently uses Qwizdom live polling tool during the provision
of some lectures and practical sessions. The university operates under a single license
forcing lecturers to book sessions before they can use the tool. Due to human nature,
session hijacking occasionally occurs to the bemusement of both students and lecturers.
For example, students could be shown biology slides half way through their geography
lecture.

This project will focus on the design and development of an in-house built Quiz Tool,
enabling multiple lecturers to use it at the same time and potentially making Qwizdom
redundant in the future. This ambition can only be achieved if the project is of
high quality and its future maintainability is considered at all stages of the design
and development.

The Quiz Tool will allow lecturers to login with their university credentials and
they will be authenticated using the university LDAP. Lecturers will then
be able to upload their PDF lecture slides and create \textit{Lectures} in the system.
Each \textit{Lecture} can be then edited and quizes can be added between slides.
An example of a quiz would be an "ABC style" question where a student can select
one of the options and submit their answer. Once a lecturer is happy with their
\textit{Lecture}, he can broadcast it and receive a session key which can be
shared with students. Lecture slides will be shown to all students and the
lecture can be delivered in a traditional fashion up to the moment a quiz
has been embedded between two slides. Students will then be able to answer
the question and polling results will be presented in real time to a lecturer.
It will be also possible to export the quiz answers as JSON for future analysis.

The tool will be composed of the back-end with an associated database, and two
front-ends. One for lecturers and one for students. Finally, the tool will be
developed using an agile methodology, adjusted for a single person project.

%==============================================================================
\section{Proposed tasks}
%==============================================================================
The following tasks will be performed on this project:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Choice of the development methodology}: an appropriate methodology has to be
    chosen for a single person project. A variation of SCRUM could be used, with weekly sprints
    and sprint planning/retrospectives shorten to the absolute minimum. This would provide the
    benefits of being able to track the velocity of the project, be able to plan ahead and stay on
    track easier, without completely "hacking" things together on day to day basis.
  \item \textbf{Technology considerations}: the MEAN stack will be used to develop the tool. MEAN
    stack consist of JavaScript based technologies (\textbf{M}ongoDB database, \textbf{E}xpress minimalistic JavaScript web
    development framework, \textbf{A}ngular 4 front-end framework and \textbf{N}odeJS a JavaScript engine).
    Some prototyping will be necessary to gain familiarity with the tools mentioned above. Furthermore,
    each part of the app will be containerised using Docker and containers will run together in the same fashion
    on the developer's machine, the build tool and in production using docker-compose container orchestration tool.
  \item \textbf{On-site vs external hosting}: it would be beneficial to keep the web application running
    within the university intranet. This however, proved impossible with the LXC debian containers available
    to students for their final year projects. The continuous integration and container deployments mentioned
    in this document will require more customisation and therfore external cloud provider has to be
    chosen to allow suitable deployment.
  \item \textbf{Setting up version control and suitable safe-guards}: the code will be stored in a private
    GitHub repository. There will be a \texttt{master} production branch, and a \texttt{development} branch.
    The feature-branch git workflow will be used and each branch will need to have an associated issue (story)
    on GitHub. Then a pull request will be opened between the \texttt{feature-branch} and the \texttt{development}
    and once all tests pass the merge will be allowed. Direct push to both \texttt{master} and \texttt{development}
    will be forbidden.
  \item \textbf{Setting up a continuous integraion build agent}: a suitable CI tool needs to be chosen. Travis, Circle CI
    and Jenkins are all appropriate for the task at hand. The build agent will checkout the code from the version control,
    build the Quiz Tool, run all the tests and deploy the tool to production if the branch being built is \texttt{master}.
  \item \textbf{Development}: as previously mentioned, an interative development approach will be used. Development will start
    with prototyping, followed by the development of "first pass" implementations of all services to get something
    working as soon as possible. Then the tool can be polished to deliver the final product. It is important to quickly
    address the most technically difficult parts of the system to avoid problems later on in the process. Special
    attention needs to be focused on the real time nature of the system and how this should be implemented. Another
    interesting problem will be the persistance of the MongoDB running in a Docker container, as Docker does not
    preserve data by design when containers are destroyed.
  \item \textbf{Project Meetings}: weekly meetings with the supervisor will provide immediate feedback on work done
    and allow re-adjustment of the approach of necessary to stay on track and delivering the software before the deadline.
