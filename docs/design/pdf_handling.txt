1. Lecturer uploads the pdf
2. PDF stored in Lecture as a blob
3. PDF sliced into Slides (id, l_id, img, text, isQuiz)
4. Dashboard renders all Lectures (with blobs removed) and first page by calling lecture.first_slide.img
5. Lecturer clicks on a Lecture
6. An array of slides pulled from the DB for the Lecture
7. Angular renders images one under the other
8. Lectuer can tap slides which should be converted to quizes. This is possible by looking
   at the slide.text and looking for bullet points
9. Lecturer saves, which updates all slides in the db
10. Broadcast
-- Student joins session --
11. Lectuer keeps the current slide in memory and pushes the img via socket.io
(potentially pushing the whole Slide model and decoding it on the other side, thus enabling
quiz rendering)
12. Students tap on A/B/C in real time
13. Socket.io used to Student -> Server -> Lecturer
14. Lecturer continues to the next slide
15. Results saved in memory for later
16. Results stored as PDF once lecture ends
